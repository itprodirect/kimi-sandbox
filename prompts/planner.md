I need to build: {{DESCRIPTION}}

Stack: {{STACK}}

Constraints:
{{CONSTRAINTS}}

Produce:
1. File tree (only files that need to exist)
2. Build order (which file to create first, and why)
3. For each file: one-sentence description of its responsibility
4. Known risks or gotchas

No boilerplate. No explanations of the stack. Just the plan.
