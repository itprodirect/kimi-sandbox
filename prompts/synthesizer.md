I'm deciding between these approaches for {{PROBLEM}}:

A: {{APPROACH_A}}
B: {{APPROACH_B}}
{{APPROACH_C}}

Context: {{CONTEXT}}

Produce a comparison table with columns:
- Approach
- Pros (max 3)
- Cons (max 3)
- When to pick it
- Estimated effort (low/med/high)

Then: one-sentence recommendation with reasoning.
