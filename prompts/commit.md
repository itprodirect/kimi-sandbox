Write a conventional commit message for this diff:

```diff
{{DIFF}}
```

Format: type(scope): description

Rules:
- type: feat, fix, refactor, docs, chore, test
- scope: the module or file area affected
- description: imperative mood, lowercase, no period, max 72 chars
- Add body only if the "why" isn't obvious from the description
