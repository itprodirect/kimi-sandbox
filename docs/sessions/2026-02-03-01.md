# Session 2026-02-03-01

## Goal
- Establish baseline benchmark metadata for 8 repos (OpenAI 4.1 results) and set up docs/log structure.

## Inputs
- Repo list: docs/benchmarks/eval-repo-github-urls.txt
- Reports: reports/rr-eval/*.json (8 files)
- Model: OpenAI 4.1 (user-confirmed)

## Actions
1. Reorganized docs into docs/ with benchmarks and sessions subfolders.
2. Moved baseline reports into reports/rr-eval/.
3. Generated reports/rr-eval/manifest.json with baseline metadata.

## Outputs
- reports/rr-eval/manifest.json
- docs/sessions/2026-02-03-01.md

## Findings
- TBD

## Decisions
- Keep benchmarks and session logs under docs/.
- Keep raw reports under reports/rr-eval/.

## Next Steps
- Run Kimi baseline on same 8 repos with identical inputs.
- Add model metadata capture in reporubric outputs.
